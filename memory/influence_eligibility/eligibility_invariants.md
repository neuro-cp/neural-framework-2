# Influence Eligibility Invariants — Phase 16

These invariants are binding.

## Authority
- Eligibility does not grant influence
- Eligibility does not bias any system
- Eligibility does not affect runtime

## Inputs
- Only inspection-visible artifacts may be evaluated
- No runtime or cognitive state is permitted

## Outputs
- Eligibility records are descriptive only
- No numeric strength, weight, or priority is allowed

## Behavior
- Policies are offline and deterministic
- No persistence or accumulation is required

## Future Use
Eligibility records may be *consumed* by a future phase
that explicitly opens influence pathways.

Until then, they are inert.
