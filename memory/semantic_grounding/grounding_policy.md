# Semantic Grounding Policy
## Phase 14 — Design-Only

This module defines **semantic → regional grounding**.

Grounding is a *descriptive association* between an existing,
promoted semantic entity and one or more neural regions.

---

## What Grounding IS

- A static association
- A human-inspectable mapping
- A way to say: “this semantic is relevant here”

---

## What Grounding IS NOT

Grounding does NOT:

- activate regions
- bias routing
- affect salience
- affect value
- influence decisions
- participate in learning
- alter runtime behavior
- imply importance or priority

Association ≠ influence.

---

## Authority Rules

- No runtime access
- No replay access
- No learning access
- No decision access

Grounding exists **outside** all authority paths.

---

## Scope Rules

Only the following regions may be grounded in Phase 14:

- pfc
- association_cortex
- hip_base
- amyg_base
- pulvinar

Any expansion requires reopening Phase 14.

---

## Assemblies

Assemblies are explicitly out of scope.

Grounding attaches to **regions only**.
Assemblies may inherit grounding later via a new phase.

---

## Removal Safety

Removing all grounding artifacts must result in:

- identical runtime behavior
- identical learning behavior
- identical decision behavior

Inspection output may differ only by absence of grounding views.

---

## Final Statement

Grounding defines **where meaning could live**  
without allowing meaning to **act**.
