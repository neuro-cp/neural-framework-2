# Proposal Channels — Phase 17 (Design-Only)

This module defines **who may propose influence**, not how influence is applied.

A proposal:
- is symbolic
- is descriptive
- carries no magnitude
- carries no authority
- may be ignored safely

Proposal ≠ Bias  
Proposal ≠ Influence  
Proposal ≠ Execution

---

## Purpose

To create a *speech layer* between:
- eligibility (Phase 16)
- any future influence system

This prevents silent power escalation.

---

## Removal Safety

Deleting this module must not alter:
- runtime behavior
- learning behavior
- decision behavior

Only inspection visibility may change.
