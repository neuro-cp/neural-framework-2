# Proposal Channel Invariants — Phase 17

These invariants are binding.

## Authority
- Proposals do not cause influence
- Proposals do not bias systems
- Proposals do not execute

## Shape
- No numeric magnitude
- No priority
- No confidence
- No strength

## Inputs
- Only eligibility-approved artifacts may be proposed from
- No runtime state allowed

## Outputs
- Proposals are symbolic only
- Targets are identifiers, not gain values

## Safety
- Channels are removable
- Channels are inspectable
- Channels are ignorable

## Future Use
A future phase may:
- accept or reject proposals
- veto proposals
- gate proposals

But never silently.
