# Failure Modes — Inspection → Policy Collapse

**Location:** `memory/inspection/docs/failure_modes/inspection_to_policy_collapse.md`

**Status:** Design-time guardrail (non-executable)

**Authority:** NONE

**Scope:** Defensive architecture for inspection and audit layers

---

## Purpose

This document enumerates architectural failure modes in which **inspection outputs**—designed to be purely descriptive—quietly become **normative policy**, despite having no execution authority.

This failure mode does not require any runtime wiring, learning, or decision logic.  
It emerges socially, procedurally, and interpretively.

---

## Invariant Being Defended

> Inspection answers **what is**.
> It must never imply **what should be**.

Inspection artifacts may summarize, compare, and contextualize system state, but must never:

- act as gates
- define success or failure
- justify execution decisions
- substitute for policy or authority

---

## 1. Descriptive Output Becomes Normative Rule

### Violation

Inspection reports are treated as **implicit policy**, even though they were never designed or authorized to function as such.

This is not enforcement by code.  
It is enforcement by convention.

---

### Mechanism (How This Sneaks In)

This failure mode typically enters through:

- Stable inspection fields reused across runs
- Diff outputs interpreted as regressions or improvements
- Audit findings treated as pass/fail conditions
- Summary language that implies evaluation or recommendation

Common rationalizations include:

> “We’re just following what the report shows.”  
> “This has always passed before.”  
> “Nothing changed except the inspection output.”

At this point, inspection has already collapsed into policy.

---

### Where It Would Appear

This collapse can surface in:

- **InspectionReport summaries**
  - aggregated counts treated as targets
  - unchanged fields treated as requirements

- **Diff tooling**
  - deltas framed as regressions rather than observations
  - baseline comparisons treated as expectations

- **Audit layers**
  - findings used to block progress
  - severity labels interpreted as authority levels

---

### Observable Symptom

One or more of the following becomes true:

- Humans ask:
  - “Why didn’t this pass inspection?”
  - “What do we need to change to satisfy the report?”

- Inspection output is referenced to justify decisions.

- System behavior is informally optimized to improve inspection metrics.

This indicates inspection has become a **control surface**.

---

### Invariant Violated

This failure mode violates the separation:

> **Observation ≠ Governance**

Once inspection output constrains behavior, authority has been introduced without acknowledgment.

---

### Required Audit Catch

This violation must be detectable through inspection self-audits:

- Detection of language implying requirement or recommendation
- Detection of inspection fields reused as thresholds
- Detection of diffs framed as success/failure
- Detection of audit findings cited as blockers

Any such usage is an architectural violation, not a reporting issue.

---

### Explicit Guardrail

The following must remain true at all times:

- Inspection reports describe state, not correctness
- Diffs indicate change, not quality
- Audits surface anomalies, not approval status

If a report can be used to answer *“should we proceed?”*, the boundary has already been crossed.

---

## Non-Resolution Clause

This document does **not** propose mitigation, enforcement, or tooling changes.

Any attempt to convert inspection findings into rules, gates, or criteria requires a new checkpoint and explicit authority grant.

Absent that, the only valid response is **architectural refusal**.
