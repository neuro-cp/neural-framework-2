=== WORKING STATE AUTHORITY & RELEASE SUMMARY ===

Baseline:
PFC mean:  0.016082
Gate mean: 0.421449
Δ mean:    0.000019

Authority (post-commit):
PFC mean:  0.016350
Gate mean: 0.472955
Δ mean:    0.000018

Release:
PFC mean:  0.015843
Gate mean: 0.540828
Δ mean:    0.000010

Expected:
- Working state engages post-commit
- Authority persists transiently
- Gate remains elevated but bounded
- Δ stays at noise floor
- Working state releases without re-decision
