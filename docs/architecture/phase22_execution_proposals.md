# Phase 22 — Learning-Driven Execution Proposals

## Purpose
Phase 22 introduces execution proposals generated by learning,
evaluation, or inspection systems. Proposals describe suggested
execution enablement but do not grant authority.

## Non-Goals
- No execution enablement
- No runtime wiring
- No gate access
- No automation

## Architecture
Learning → Proposal → Evaluation → Governance → Enablement

## Invariants
- Pure data
- Auditable
- No runtime edges
