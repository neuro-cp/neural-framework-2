# Phase 24 — Governance → Enablement Bridging

## Purpose
Define how approved governance decisions are translated into
execution enablement requests without enabling execution.

## Scope
Design-only. No runtime wiring, no gate access.

## Invariants
- Governance remains authoritative
- Enablement remains inert
- No runtime or execution state mutation
