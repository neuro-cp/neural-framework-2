# Phase 14 — Semantic → Regional Grounding  
## Forbidden Extensions & Guardrails

**Phase:** 14  
**Status:** Enforced  
**Reopening Required For Any Violation**

---

## 1. Absolute Prohibitions

The following are **explicitly forbidden** in Phase 14:

- numeric weights
- gain modulation
- routing influence
- salience shaping
- value bias
- urgency bias
- decision bias
- replay feedback
- learning signals
- plasticity hooks
- temporal dynamics
- assembly targeting
- subpopulation targeting

Any appearance of these constitutes a phase violation.

---

## 2. No Implicit Semantics

Grounding must never imply:
- importance
- priority
- relevance strength
- confidence
- activation likelihood

Association ≠ endorsement.

---

## 3. No Structural Mutation

Grounding artifacts must never:
- modify region JSONs
- modify population definitions
- annotate assemblies
- alter loaders
- alter runtime context

All grounding is **external and observational**.

---

## 4. Assemblies Are Explicitly Out of Scope

Phase 14 grounding:
- does not reference assemblies
- does not inherit structural differentiation
- does not define assembly semantics

Assemblies may only inherit grounding in future phases
via explicit, reopened contracts.

---

## 5. Forward-Compatibility Clause

This phase intentionally does **not** block future work, but:

- any future influence requires a new phase
- any learning requires a new phase
- any runtime coupling requires a new phase

Phase 14 artifacts must remain valid even if never extended.

---

## 6. Enforcement Rule

If grounding artifacts:
- change behavior
- change inspection counts
- appear in runtime traces
- appear in replay traces

then Phase 14 has been violated.

---

## 7. Final Assertion

Grounding is **interpretive anatomy**.

It describes *where meaning could live*  
without allowing meaning to *do anything*.
