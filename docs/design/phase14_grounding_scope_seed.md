Phase 14 — Semantic → Regional Grounding
Grounding Scope Definition (Seed v1)

Phase: 14
Status: AUTHORIZED — Design-Only
Authority: None
Execution: Prohibited
Learning / Plasticity: Prohibited

This document defines the minimal, canonical scope for semantic → regional grounding in Phase 14. It intentionally limits grounding to a small set of regions to preserve auditability, reversibility, and conceptual clarity.

1. Purpose

Phase 14 introduces semantic grounding as a descriptive correspondence between promoted semantic entities and neural regions.

Grounding answers only:

“Which regions are plausibly associated with a semantic concept?”

Grounding does not:

cause activity

bias routing

alter gain

shape salience

influence value

affect decision thresholds

persist state

imply importance

Grounding defines association, not effect.

2. Grounding Scope Rule (Non-Negotiable)

Only regions that already function as information convergence hubs may be grounded in Phase 14.

A region qualifies if it:

integrates signals from multiple subsystems

participates in cognition without direct execution authority

is already audited for isolation and non-authority

does not directly gate decisions or motor output

Regions that are:

purely sensory

purely motor

purely modulatory

purely endocrine

purely gating

are explicitly excluded at this phase.

3. Canonical Grounding Seed Regions

Phase 14 (Seed v1) is restricted to exactly five regions.

No additional regions may be grounded without a new scope revision.

3.1 Prefrontal Cortex (PFC)

Region ID: pfc

Justification:

Central cognitive convergence hub

Interfaces with thalamic, hippocampal, and basal ganglia systems

Already structurally isolated from decision authority

Already audited for policy vs execution separation

Grounding Meaning:

Semantic relevance at the level of executive representation

Conceptual reference only

Explicit Non-Implications:

No policy shaping

No decision bias

No working-memory persistence

No control authority

3.2 Association Cortex

Region ID: association_cortex

Justification:

Multimodal integration (visual, auditory, thalamic)

Explicitly non-decisional workspace

Natural substrate for abstraction and cross-modal association

Grounding Meaning:

Semantic abstraction and associative relevance

Explicit Non-Implications:

No competition resolution

No representation prioritization

No downstream bias

3.3 Hippocampal Formation (Base)

Region ID: hip_base / hippocampal_formation

Justification:

Canonical interface between episodic and semantic systems

Already participates in replay and consolidation architecture

Base-level container avoids premature subfield commitments

Grounding Meaning:

Semantic ancestry and episodic linkage

Explicit Non-Implications:

No recall

No replay modulation

No memory activation

3.4 Amygdala (Base)

Region ID: amyg_base / amygdala

Justification:

Affective relevance without execution

Feeds multiple systems while remaining non-authoritative

Base container avoids subregion semantic commitments

Grounding Meaning:

Emotional relevance tagging only

Explicit Non-Implications:

No salience generation

No fear/reward semantics

No physiological triggering

3.5 Pulvinar

Region ID: pulvinar

Justification:

Cross-modal coordination nucleus

Operates as an associative relay, not a primary gate

Already audited for safe relay behavior

Grounding Meaning:

Perceptual coordination relevance

Explicit Non-Implications:

No attentional capture

No salience amplification

No gain modulation

4. Explicit Exclusions (Phase-14 Hard Boundary)

The following are explicitly excluded from semantic grounding in Phase 14:

Sensory input regions (visual_input, auditory_input, etc.)

Primary sensory cortices (V1, A1, S1)

Motor cortices (M1)

Basal ganglia structures (striatum, GPi, GPe, STN)

Neuromodulatory nuclei (VTA, SNc, LC, Raphe)

Thalamic control nuclei (TRN)

Endocrine structures

Cerebellar structures

Grounding any excluded region requires reopening scope.

5. Field Interpretation Rules

Grounding may read only:

region_id

region existence

population names (existence only)

structural inputs/outputs (region-to-region existence only)

Grounding must ignore:

firing rates

plasticity profiles

drug sensitivity

gain modulation

state modulation

semantic-looking annotations

subpopulation roles

notes describing behavior

Metadata is non-binding narrative, not truth.

6. Assemblies (Explicitly Deferred)

Phase 14 grounding:

does not reference assemblies

does not reference subpopulations

does not inherit differentiation

Grounding attaches to region identity only.

Assemblies may later inherit grounding, but never define it.

7. Removal Safety

All Phase-14 grounding artifacts must be:

fully removable

leave zero behavioral delta

affect inspection output only

If removal changes runtime, replay, cognition, or learning behavior, Phase 14 has been violated.

8. Certification Statement

Phase 14 grounding is considered valid when:

semantics can be associated with the five seed regions

associations are inspectable and exportable

no execution paths exist

no numeric interpretation is possible

no authority edges are introduced

9. Final Assertion

Semantic grounding is interpretive anatomy, not cognition.

It describes where meaning could live
without allowing meaning to act.
