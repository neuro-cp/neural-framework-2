# Delta-75  
## A Governance-First Cognitive Substrate

Delta-75 is an **architecture-focused cognitive substrate** built around **containment-before-influence**, explicit **execution gating**, and **auditable influence pathways**.

It is **not** a model.  
It is **not** a fine-tuning layer.  
It is **not** a wrapper around an LLM.

Delta-75 is a **structural governance framework** intended to sit beneath or alongside learning systems, enforcing a strict separation between **cognition**, **authorization**, and **execution**.

## Core Principles

1. **Containment Before Influence**  
   No cognitive signal may influence live system state without passing through an explicit execution gate.

2. **Separation of Cognition and Authority**  
   Interpretation, evaluation, and execution are structurally distinct layers. No component is permitted implicit authority.

3. **Auditable Influence Pathways**  
   All influence proposals are traceable, bounded, and inspectable prior to application.

4. **Deterministic Offline Learning**  
   Learning processes are replay-driven, governance-audited, and execution-inert by default.

5. **Identity-Safe Execution Toggle**  
   When execution is disabled, the runtime is provably identity-equivalent (identity transform within tolerance).

## Architectural Overview

Delta-75 is organized into the following layers:

- **Runtime Core** — region-based substrate with bounded propagation mechanics  
- **Competition Kernel** — deterministic signal arbitration  
- **Salience Field** — structured signal filtering  
- **Decision Layer** — explicit latch-based commitment mechanics  
- **Execution Gate** — single choke point for live influence  
- **Governance Chain** — Audit → Calibration → Record → Approval  
- **Inspection Layer** — immutable reporting and diffing  
- **Replay & Learning Pipeline** — offline, non-authoritative adaptation

**Invariant:** no learning artifact or cognitive interpretation may directly mutate runtime state.

## Design Philosophy

Delta-75 explores the hypothesis that alignment is not primarily a training problem, but an **architectural** problem.

Instead of relying on emergent constraints, Delta-75 enforces **structural authority boundaries** at the substrate level. The goal is to make influence **explicit**, **bounded**, and **inspectable**—not implicit.

---

## Intended Use

Delta-75 is intended for:

- alignment research
- governance-layer experimentation
- execution containment modeling
- safety-first cognitive architecture prototyping

It is not optimized for benchmark performance or consumer deployment.
