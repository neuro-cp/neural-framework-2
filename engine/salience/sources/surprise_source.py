    PURPOSE:
    - Detect unexpected deviation in structurally meaningful signals
    - Highlight novelty prior to attention, value, or decision
    - Remain pre-semantic and pre-decisional

    BIOLOGICAL ANALOG:
    - Early cortical mismatch detection
    - Sensory / associative prediction error (pre-dopaminergic)

    DESIGN GUARANTEES:
    - Stateless
    - Symmetric (no valence)
    - Conservative magnitude
    - Ignores meta-time and control drift
