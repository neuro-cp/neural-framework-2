    Competition-based salience source.

    PURPOSE:
    - Highlight relative dominance during competition
    - Increase attentional weight of leading channels
    - WITHOUT triggering or enforcing decisions

    BIOLOGICAL ANALOG:
    - Cortico-striatal contrast enhancement
    - Pre-decisional attentional bias

    DESIGN GUARANTEES:
    - Stateless
    - Relative (contrast-based)
    - Bounded and conservative

        - Winner gets small positive salience
